# ESP8266 + HC-SR04 + MB102 = Open Garage Door Notifier

My crappy cobbling together of code for my ESP8266 module which uses a HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. This is a dirty hack together of code. Use as you wish. Don't cry if you think the code is shitty.

Change the SSID and PASSWORD to the real values in init.lua.

Change the GPIO pin assignments and YOUR_API_KEY for Notify My Android in hcsr04.lua.
